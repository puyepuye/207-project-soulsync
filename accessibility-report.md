For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:


1. Equitable Use: design that does notdisadvantage or stigmatize any group of users
2. Flexibility in Use: design that accommodates a wide range of individual preferences and abilities
3. Simple, Intuitive Use: The buttons clearly communicate what they do, either through text or icons. It is clearly stated if a button signs you up or logs you in. However, the navbar's icon for compatibility might be a little bit too abstract for some users
4. Perceptible Information: The UI somewhat has low contrast, which might cause trouble for those who are visually impaired. For those with no vision, they will not be able to use the app, but we could add a reader that reads every element that they hover on (similiar to how Apple implements it)
5. Tolerance for Error: The app doesn't currently adhere to this, we could add features to confirm if a user wants to swipe on someone or enable users to edit messages. We could also add confirmation dialogues before you create an account or login.
6. Low Physical Effort: It does not take much physical effor as this could easily be navigated with a mouse / trackpad + keyboard. The UI elements are big enough to be easily clicked no matter which kind of input you use.
7. Size and Space for Approach and Use: The UI size might be a little bit too small for those with impaired vision. We could add a feature to increase the font size or use a more high contrast UI Theme.
(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or

(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.

We would market this programn towards teenagers (of legal age) and young adults, for they are the demographic that would most likely be looking for partner, friendship or relationshios.
This program would be free to use because this way, it would draw the biggest amount of users, which benefits us since the app relies on having a lot of users in order for there to be enough matches for people. 

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.
