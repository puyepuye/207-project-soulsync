For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features your program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:
(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or
(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.

1. **Equitable Use:** As long as our users understand English and has access to the internet, they will have no problem in using our app. In order to make more accessible, we could implement a language switching feature for the ui in case our user might not be from a country where english is mainly used.
2. **Flexibility in Use:** In tersms of flexibility, we are a bit limited at this point, as this app is only designed to run on a desktop platform. It requires configuring API keys and environment variables which might not be possible on devices such as phones or tablets. We would have to do further research in order to have our authentication and database features production ready.
3. **Simple, Intuitive Use:** The buttons clearly communicate what they do, it is clearly stated if a button signs you up or logs you in. However, the navbar's icon for compatibility might be a little bit too abstract for some users. We could potentially design new icons for the app that are easier to read / comprehend.
4. **Perceptible Information:** The UI somewhat has low contrast, which might cause trouble for those who are visually impaired. For those with no vision, they will not be able to use the app, but we could add a reader that reads every element that they hover on (similiar to how Apple implements it)
5. **Tolerance for Error:** The app doesn't currently adhere to this, we could add features to confirm if a user wants to swipe on someone or enable users to edit messages. We could also add confirmation dialogues before you create an account or login.
6. **Low Physical Effort**: It does not take much physical effor as this could easily be navigated with a mouse / trackpad + keyboard. The UI elements are big enough to be easily clicked no matter which kind of input you use.
7. **Size and Space for Approach and Use:** The UI size might be a little bit too small for those with impaired vision. We could add a feature to increase the font size or use a more high contrast UI Theme.


Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your program to customers. 

We would market this programn towards teenagers (of legal age) and young adults, for they are the demographic that would most likely be looking for partner, friendship or relationships. This demographic is incredibly busy, so having something they can easily access through an app to allow them to find like minded people for whatever activity they intend to would be very much convenient. This program would be free to use because this way, it would draw the biggest amount of users, which benefits us since the app relies on having a lot of users in order for there to be enough matches for people. 

Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.

Our app could be less likely to be used by people of an older age. The older generation may be less inclined to the idea of meeting people through an online platform, driving them away from the premise of this app. They may not be as familiar with technology as the younger generation is, but they are not at a huge loss for the benefit that this app could provide them, as people of that group often already have solidified friends / relationships.
