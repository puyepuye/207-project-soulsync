- Users can select other users to match with Tinder swipe style
- Users can be matched based on preferences or through our in house Fengshui compatability calculator!
- After a user has been matched, users can chat with the other matched user in real time.

## Notes for connecting pages
1. After implementing view must add to MainWithDB set up with UseCaseFactory which follows flow:      
   - loginInteractor (execute which calles loginPresenter.prepareSuccessView
   - login interactor executi is inplementation of logininputBoundary.java
   - loginController calls loginUseCaseInteractor.exe
   - LoginView.java
   ```bash
          loginController.execute(
                    currentState.getUsername()
                    currentState.getPassword()
                   );
   ```
