#### 1. Verify `MainWithDB` Functionality
- Ensure that `MainWithDB` still runs as expected (from Lab 5).
- Re-clone and re-run if needed.

#### 2. Create a New Branch with Your UTORid
- Create and switch to a branch with your UTORid as the branch name.

```bash
  git branch chuyian
  git switch chuyian
  git branch
   ```

4. Try adding your name under Contributors in ReadME and make a Pull Request. Happy!

Follow pull request instructions in terminal, make sure "branch has no conflicts with the base branch".
